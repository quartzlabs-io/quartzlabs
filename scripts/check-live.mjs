/**
 * Interrogates the deployed site, which is the only place these can be observed.
 *
 * Every other check in this repository reads dist/, and dist/ cannot know what
 * the host does with it. Four defects reached production that way: a directory
 * route answering 307 before 200, plain HTTP answering 200 with no redirect at
 * all, TLS 1.0 still accepted, and a managed robots.txt injected at the edge
 * that told the AI crawlers the file itself invites to go away.
 *
 * None of those live in the repository. They live in dashboard state, which
 * means a click can undo any of them and nothing here would notice. That is
 * what this converts into a failing build.
 *
 *   npm run check:live
 *
 * Not part of `npm run verify`, deliberately. verify runs before a push, when
 * the live site is still the previous commit.
